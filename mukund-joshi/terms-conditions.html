        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall

            fails of its essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
            limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
            means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these
            states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent
            permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h2>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>

            undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service

            can or will be corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
            company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
            express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
            Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
            included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or

            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
            warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
            consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
            not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
            set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
            enforceable under applicable law.
